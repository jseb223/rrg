"The first people to come to the Red River Gorge arrived about 13,000 years ago when glaciers still covered much of the land to the north. Small bands of ice-age hunters, now called Paleo-Indians, followed herds of mastodons and woolly mammoths". - https://www.fs.usda.gov/

"Red River Gorge, in Daniel Boone National Forest in east-central Kentucky, was formed as the Red River cut through sandstone creating steep-sided narrow valleys, a magnet for rock climbers... Holes worn in softer, lower sandstone layers have produced more than 100 natural arches in the gorge -- unique formations in the eastern United States". - https://www.cbsnews.com/
