I selected Double Arch for my mapping project. The trek to Double Arch is a moderately difficult 2.5 mile hike. Once I parked at the end of Tunnel Ridge Road, I embarked on the hike. The beginning of the trail is along a gravel road but you must follow a narrow trail down into a valley to reach Double Arch. I was able to access the rrg.pdf via Avenza Maps while I was in the field but I was not able to get a good estimate for the size of Double Arch. <br />
It was difficult to measure with Avenza because the scale of the pdf was to small and my finders were getting in the way. Although, the GPS locator on my phone did correctly place me on the red pin for the Double Arch landform that I created in ArcGIS Pro. The locator was very accurate but to accurately measure the width of the arch, the scale of the pdf would essentially need to be zoomed in on just my landform. <br />
While in the field, I estimated that the top of Double Arch was about 90-120 feet above trail level but my best estimate was 100-110 feet. Double Arch consists of a larger lower arch and a smaller arch immediately above the larger. The large arch was 15-20 feet above the top of the cliff and the smaller arch crest was about 5 feet above the crest of the larger arch. I estimated that the arches were 25-30 feet wide. At the top of the cliff where Double Arch stands, I noted sandstones, conglomerates, and cross bedding. The presence of the erosional and weathering resistant rocks sheds light on why the Double Arch still still stands.
