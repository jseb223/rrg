I selected Double Arch for my mapping project. The trek to Double Arch is a moderately difficult 2.5 mile hike. Once I parked at the end of Tunnel Ridge Road, I embarked on the hike. The beginning is along a gravel road but you must follow a narrow trail down into a valley to follow the trail up to Double Arch. <br/>

The arch is at one of the higher point in the Red River Gorge and presented an amazing view.

As you approached end of the trail, the arch is visible from ground level. I estimated the top of the arch to be 100-110 feet above trail level.

I estimated that the width of the arch was between 25 and 30 feet. The second smaller arch is situated about 5 feet above the main arch.

At the top of the arch, I found weathering resistant sandstone along with some conglomerate layers. There was also some cross bedding observable on the left wall of the arch. I estimated the top of the main arch stood about 15-20 feet above the opening.
